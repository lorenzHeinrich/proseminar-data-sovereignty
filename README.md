This work is part of the course "Proseminar Data Sovereignty" of the Karlsruher Institute of Technology where different aspects of data sovereignty are examined based on the paper: "SoK: Data Sovereignty".

# Abstract
In the era of digitalization, online collaboration, and artificial intelligence data plays a crucial role.
However, the practices this data is managed often disregard the user's privacy, and power over this data is increasingly accumulated by large enterprises.
This work aims to provide an understanding of the domain of data management, particularly focusing on access control for privacy-sensitive data.
It analyzes the status quo in which individuals find themselves by having to rely on centralized authorization services, introduces a theoretical decentralized access control model, and discusses the potential improvements decentralized technologies can offer.
Furthermore, it explores the role of decentralized access control within the broader context of data sovereignty identifying its contributions and dependencies.
