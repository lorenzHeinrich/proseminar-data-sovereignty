	abstract = {Society appears to be on the verge of recognizing the need for control over sensitive data in modern web applications. Recently, many systems claim to give control to individuals, promising the preeminent goal of data sovereignty. However, despite recent attention, research and industry efforts are fragmented and lack a holistic system overview. In this paper, we provide the first transecting systematization of data sovereignty by drawing from a dispersed body of knowledge. We clarify the field by identifying its three main areas: (i) decentralized identity, (ii) decentralized access control and (iii) policy-compliant decentralized computation. We find that literature lacks a cohesive set of formal definitions. Each area is considered in isolation, and priorities in industry and academia are not aligned due to a lack of clarity regarding user control. To solve this issue, we propose formal definitions for each sub-area. By highlighting that data sovereignty transcends the domain of decentralized identity, we aim to guide future works to embrace a broader perspective on user control. In each section, we augment our definition with security and privacy properties, discuss the state of the art and proceed to identify open challenges. We conclude by highlighting synergies between areas, emphasizing the real-world benefit obtained by further developing data sovereign systems.},

	abstract = {OAuth has become a highly influential protocol due to its swift and wide adoption in the industry. The initial objective of the protocol was specific: it serves the authorization needs for websites. What motivates our work is the realization that the protocol has been significantly re-purposed and re-targeted over the years: (1) all major identity providers, e.g., Facebook, Google and Microsoft, have re-purposed OAuth for user authentication; (2) developers have re-targeted OAuth to the mobile platforms, in addition to the traditional web platform. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary and timely to conduct an in-depth study to demystify OAuth for mobile application developers. Our work consists of two pillars: (1) an in-house study of the OAuth protocol documentation that aims to identify what might be ambiguous or unspecified for mobile developers; (2) a field-study of over 600 popular mobile applications that highlights how well developers fulfill the authentication and authorization goals in practice. The result is really worrisome: among the 149 applications that use OAuth, 89 of them (59.7\%) were incorrectly implemented and thus vulnerable. In the paper, we pinpoint the key portions in each OAuth protocol flow that are security critical, but are confusing or unspecified for mobile application developers. We then show several representative cases to concretely explain how real implementations fell into these pitfalls. Our findings have been communicated to vendors of the vulnerable applications. Most vendors positively confirmed the issues, and some have applied fixes. We summarize lessons learned from the study, hoping to provoke further thoughts about clear guidelines for OAuth usage in mobile applications.},

	abstract = {Distributed ledger technologies provide high availability and
integrity, making them a key enabler for practical and secure
computation of distributed workloads among mutually distrustful parties.
However, many practical applications also
require confidentiality, the third pillar of the CIA triad. In
this work, we enhance permissioned and permissionless blockchains with the ability to manage confidential data without
forfeiting availability or decentralization. More specifically,
CALYPSO sets out to achieve two orthogonal goals that
challenge modern distributed ledgers: (a) enable blockchains
to auditably manage secrets and (b) protect distributed computations against arbitrage attacks when their results depend
on the ordering and secrecy of inputs.

To this end, CALYPSO proposes on-chain secrets, a novel
abstraction that enforces atomic deposition of an auditable
trace whenever users access confidential data. Furthermore,
CALYPSO provides user-controlled consent management
that ensures revocation atomicity and accountable anonymity.
Finally, to enable the permissionless deployment of CALYPSO, we introduce an incentive scheme and provide users
with the option to select their preferred trustees. We evaluated our CALYPSO prototype with a confidential document
sharing application and a decentralized lottery. Our benchmarks show that the latency of processing transactions increases linearly to the added security (in number of trustees)
and is in the range of 0.2 to 8 seconds for 16 to 128 trustees.},

a means to derive a sequence of temporally-related keys from the most
recent key. In this paper we show that, despite natural intuition to
the contrary, key rotation schemes cannot generically be used to key
other cryptographic objects; in fact, keying an encryption scheme with
the output of a key rotation scheme can yield a composite system that
is insecure. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a new
cryptographic object called a key regression scheme, and we
propose three constructions that are provably secure under standard
cryptographic assumptions. We implement key regression in a secure
file system and empirically show that key regression can significantly
reduce the bandwidth requirements of a content publisher under
realistic workloads using lazy revocation. Our experiments also serve
as the first empirical evaluation of either a key rotation or key
regression scheme.},
